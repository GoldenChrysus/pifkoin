What is this?
=============

I've been curious about Bitcoin, mining in particular.  Optimizing the mining
code seems like an interesting chance to play with FPGAs and cryptography.

Contained within this repository are some experiments used to dig into it.
Probably not useful for anyone else, but feel free to take a look.
